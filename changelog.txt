v1.3.0
    -Added the Ticket module, allows viewing user-submitted tickets (regarding username changes, reports, etc).
    -Added a rate limiter to all API calls to follow the site's API guidelines. Now no more than 2 API calls will be made per second.
    -Changed the user agent string to represent the library, rather than spoofing Firefox.
    -Added a new exception for site load errors.
    -Added the "change" property to the Post module, returns the timestamp of the last change to the post.
    -Added an option to pretty-print exported metadata in `Post.download_metadata` for readability.
    -Updated the downloader example script.
    -NOTE: During testing for this release, all attempts to login through the library received an "Invalid auth token" error. It has not yet been determined if this is an issue with the library or a server-side change, but logins may not work properly for the time being.
