# Python Esix #

An easy to use Python 3 frontend for e621.net's JSON API. Currently includes all basic site functionality, from searching posts to getting user information to managing tags.

## Setup ##
### Dependencies ###
* [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/files/pywin32/) for Python 3.4+ is recommended to properly use the file downloading functionality. The script will run without it but metadata files may not be properly hidden.

Currently there is no setup file for this library. For now simply download the esix folder into your project's root, and `import esix` to load the library.
